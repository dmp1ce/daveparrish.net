I finally had some time today to update the contact and about pages.
I think they summurize my life at this moment pretty well.

I have also created a offline copy of the old website using HTTrack and
added apache redirects to the old pages.

The reason for this is because I didn't really want to maintain the
old Drupal website anymore.  It made more sense for me to simply have
a static blog.  Users are still welcome to contact me at my email or
bitmessage if they want to comment on something that I have written.
At some point I might ad disqus but at this point I don't think it is necessary.

BTW, this project is completely open source, so if you want to see
how I did anything then you can visit my project on github:

* [daveparrish.net hakyll blog](https://github.com/dmp1ce/daveparrish.net)
* [daveparrish.net vagrant environment](https://github.com/dmp1ce/daveparrish.net-vagrant)

*Note*:
At this point, the blog isn't actually online, so this post is just for archive
purposes.  At some point I would like to add more in depth information about how
I used hakyll, apache and httrack to create this blog.
