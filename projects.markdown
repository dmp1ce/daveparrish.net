## Contracts, a Redmine plugin

I have been helping manage the development of the Redmine Contracts module.
[UpgradeYa](http://webpagedesigncompany.net)
is funding the project and I have been the project manager and client for three
seperate ruby developers. Currently, the plugin is stable and we are adding
fixes for any bugs that are found.

This plugin us used on the UpgradeYa Redmine website to help manage contracts with
our clients.

## Reddit OAuth Drupal module

Developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), the purpose of this
module is to allow Drupal websites to easily integrate with the Reddit OAuth API.

## Subreddit Drupal module

Also developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), this module is both
an example of how to leverage the Reddit OAuth module and provides an easy way of
integrating a Reddit subreddit into a Drupal website.
