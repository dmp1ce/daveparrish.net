title: About
---
I am a freelance web developer by profession and you can see most of my work on
the company page at [UpgradeYa.com](http://webpagedesigncompany.net). The purpose
of this site is to share my more personal interests and projects.

### Current Projects

#### Family

Right now my wife is in the middle of pregnancy and I'm very excited!
I'm in the process of cleaning out
a bunch of old junk in the house to make room for more members of the family.
I'm also trying to set aside some savings
so that I can spend a lot of time around the child for the first 2 to 3 years.
I hope I have enough money saved up!

#### Free Talk Live

I helped transition [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com) into a Drupal 6
website a few years ago and have been the Drupal maintainer on that website
since then.

#### Reddit OAuth Drupal module

Developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), the purpose of this
module is to allow Drupal websites to easily integrate with the Reddit OAuth API.

#### Subreddit Drupal module

Also developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), this module is both
an example of how to leverage the Reddit OAuth module and provides an easy way of
integrating a Reddit subreddit into any Drupal 6 website.

#### Contracts, a Redmine plugin

I have been helping manage the development of the Redmine Contracts module.
[UpgradeYa](http://webpagedesigncompany.net)
is funding the project and I have been the project manager and client for two
seperate ruby developers.  Currently, the plugin is stable and we are adding
fixes for any bugs that are found.  Some features may still be added in the future
but none are planned at the moment.

This plugin us used on the UpgradeYa Redmine website to help manage contracts with
our clients.

### My Interests

#### Bitcoin

I became very interested in economics around 2010 and that is when I stumbled upon
bitcoin. I now exchange my services for bitcoin and I am a local exchanger in the
Raleigh area. You can often find me at the
[Triangle Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/) which
I help organize.

#### Health & Fitness

I have been into fitness since the 1990s when I was involved in cross country and
track sports.  I was convinced that regular exercise was an important part of
health for the human body.  Although, 20 years later I learned that
nutrition is an equally, if not more, important part of health.  I learned this
lesson because of chronic respiratory problems I was having, which was only cured
by changing my diet to a diet which more closely conforms to what ancient humans
might have eaten. Much of my understanding about this new way of eating is from
the book
[Deadly Harvest](http://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Harvest-Intimate-Relationship-Between/dp/0757001424).

#### Philosophy and self knowledge

Through much of my early life I had little understanding of philosophy and I had
even less knowledge about myself.  I was disconnected with my own emotions
and I didn't know what made me happy.  After several bouts of mild
depression due to unfulfilling jobs and relationships, I was finally about to
begin making some decisions in my life which I believe lead me to a more
sustainable and happy life.

I feel like I owe this change to several online resources and books including
[Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com),
[FreedomainRadio](http://www.freedomainradio.com/),
[Complete Liberty](http://completeliberty.com/) and
[Nathanal Branden's The Six Pillars of Self Esteem](http://www.amazon.com/The-Six-Pillars-Self-Esteem-Definitive/dp/0553374397).
I am also lucky to have had supportive friends and
family while I made changes which surely challenged (threatened) their own
beliefs.

I now believe that the best way to get my needs met and the needs of others
in my life is to practice
[Non-Violent Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)
(NVC). I look forward to sharing, with those close in my life, strategies on
how to communicate with each other in such a way that we are constantly
trying to maximize the happiness in each of our lives. This can sometimes be
a challenge as many feel they can only get their needs met at the expense of
another.

#### Gaming

Right now I'm spending most of free time, which isn't much, playing Magic the
Gathering. I had played when I was younger, but have picked it back up again.
I have just discovered that I can do free drafts with friends by building a 
"cube" deck.
[Here is my cube on CubeTutor.](http://cubetutor.com/viewcube/395)

#### Linux

I'm a linux fanboy. Mostly because I am dedicated to the idea of open source.
I try to run all my devices on open source software and I try to stay up to
date on new open source technologies.  Right now I am running Gentoo on my
laptop and it has been quite a learning experience. I also have some computers
running Ubuntu, Mint, Debian and CentOS.
I still use Windows for gaming from time to time, but I have been happy to
see more an more games coming to linux.
I also hope to give FreeBSD a try soon as I have heard it is also a great
open source operating system.
