title: About
---
I am a freelance web developer by profession working primarily with
[UpgradeYa](http://upgradeya.net). I also maintain a bunch of obscure open
source projects, mostly hosted on [Github](https://github.com/dmp1ce).

## Family

My most important project is my family. I spend as much time as I can with my
wife and children. I figured out how I could work from home, partly to spend more
time with my family.

## Free Talk Live

I helped transition [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com) into a Drupal 7
website and I am one of the current maintainers.

## Open Source

I work on various projects to help me (and hopefully others) use Linux and other
open source projects. See my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/dmp1ce)
to follow my work and support me. I also have a [list of other projects](/projects.html) I have worked on.

## Bitcoin

I exchange my services for bitcoin and I am a local exchanger in the
Raleigh, North Carolina area. You can often find me at the
[Triangle Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/) which
I help organize. If you are interested, my current bitcoin price can be found with [this calculator](https://dmp1ce.github.io/Dave-s-BTC-Price).

## Health & Fitness

I have been into fitness since the 1990s when I was involved in cross country and
track sports.  I was convinced that regular exercise was an important part of
health for the human body.  Although, 20 years later I learned that
nutrition is an equally, if not more, important part of health.  I learned this
lesson because of chronic respiratory problems I was having, which was only cured
by changing my diet to a diet which more closely conforms to what ancient humans
might have eaten. Much of my understanding about this new way of eating is from
the book
[Paleo in a Nutshell: Living and Eating the Way Nature Intended](https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Nutshell-Living-Eating-Intended/dp/0757004504).

## Philosophy and self knowledge

Through much of my early life I had little understanding of philosophy and I had
even less knowledge about myself. I was disconnected with my own emotions
and I didn't know what made me happy. After several bouts of mild
depression due to unfulfilling jobs and relationships, I was finally about to
begin making some decisions in my life which I believe lead me to a more
sustainable and happy life.

I feel like I owe this change to several online resources and books including
[Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com),
[Freedomain Radio](http://www.freedomainradio.com/),
[Complete Liberty](http://completeliberty.com/) and
[Nathanal Branden's The Six Pillars of Self Esteem](http://www.amazon.com/The-Six-Pillars-Self-Esteem-Definitive/dp/0553374397).
I am also lucky to have had supportive friends and
family while I made changes which surely challenged (threatened) their own
beliefs.

I look forward to sharing, with those close in my life, strategies on
how to communicate with each other in such a way that we are constantly
trying to achieve happiness in each of our lives. This can sometimes be
a challenge as many feel they can only get their needs met at the expense of
another.

## Gaming

When I have time I enjoy gaming but not playing much at the moment. I do however
have time to listen to Video Game Music while I'm working which I really enjoy. One
of my favorite shows is [Game Fuel](http://kngi.org/category/past-episodes-gamefuel/).

## Linux

I'm a linux fanboy. Mostly because I am dedicated to the idea of open source.
I try to run all my devices on open source software and I try to stay up to
date on new open source technologies. Right now I am running Arch Linux on my
laptop. Before that I ran Gentoo, which was quite a learning experience.
I still use Windows (and a [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/)) for gaming, but I have been happy to see more an more games coming to Linux.
