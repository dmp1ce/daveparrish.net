I am a freelance web developer by profession and you can see my company website
at [UpgradeYa.com](http://webpagedesigncompany.net). The purpose of this site
is to share my more personal interests and projects.

### Current Projects

#### Family

My most important project is my family. I spend as much time as I can with my
wife and son. I figured out how I could work from home, partly to spend more
time with my family.

#### Free Talk Live

I helped transition [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com) into a Drupal 7
website and I am one of the current maintainers.

#### Reddit OAuth Drupal module

Developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), the purpose of this
module is to allow Drupal websites to easily integrate with the Reddit OAuth API.

#### Subreddit Drupal module

Also developed for [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com), this module is both
an example of how to leverage the Reddit OAuth module and provides an easy way of
integrating a Reddit subreddit into a Drupal website.

#### Contracts, a Redmine plugin

I have been helping manage the development of the Redmine Contracts module.
[UpgradeYa](http://webpagedesigncompany.net)
is funding the project and I have been the project manager and client for three
seperate ruby developers. Currently, the plugin is stable and we are adding
fixes for any bugs that are found.

This plugin us used on the UpgradeYa Redmine website to help manage contracts with
our clients.

### My Interests

#### Bitcoin

I became very interested in economics around 2010 and that is when I stumbled upon
bitcoin. I now exchange my services for bitcoin and I am a local exchanger in the
Raleigh area. You can often find me at the
[Triangle Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/) which
I help organize. If you are interested, my current bitcoin price can be found with [this calculator](https://dmp1ce.github.io/Dave-s-BTC-Price).

#### Health & Fitness

I have been into fitness since the 1990s when I was involved in cross country and
track sports.  I was convinced that regular exercise was an important part of
health for the human body.  Although, 20 years later I learned that
nutrition is an equally, if not more, important part of health.  I learned this
lesson because of chronic respiratory problems I was having, which was only cured
by changing my diet to a diet which more closely conforms to what ancient humans
might have eaten. Much of my understanding about this new way of eating is from
the book
[Deadly Harvest](http://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Harvest-Intimate-Relationship-Between/dp/0757001424).

#### Philosophy and self knowledge

Through much of my early life I had little understanding of philosophy and I had
even less knowledge about myself.  I was disconnected with my own emotions
and I didn't know what made me happy.  After several bouts of mild
depression due to unfulfilling jobs and relationships, I was finally about to
begin making some decisions in my life which I believe lead me to a more
sustainable and happy life.

I feel like I owe this change to several online resources and books including
[Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com),
[FreedomainRadio](http://www.freedomainradio.com/),
[Complete Liberty](http://completeliberty.com/) and
[Nathanal Branden's The Six Pillars of Self Esteem](http://www.amazon.com/The-Six-Pillars-Self-Esteem-Definitive/dp/0553374397).
I am also lucky to have had supportive friends and
family while I made changes which surely challenged (threatened) their own
beliefs.

I now believe that the best way to get my needs met and the needs of others
in my life is to practice
[Non-Violent Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)
(NVC). I look forward to sharing, with those close in my life, strategies on
how to communicate with each other in such a way that we are constantly
trying to maximize the happiness in each of our lives. This can sometimes be
a challenge as many feel they can only get their needs met at the expense of
another.

#### Gaming

When I have time I enjoy gaming but not playing much at the moment. I do however
have time to listen to Video Game Music while I'm working which I really enjoy. One
of my favorite shows is [Game Fuel](http://kngi.org/category/past-episodes-gamefuel/).

#### Linux

I'm a linux fanboy. Mostly because I am dedicated to the idea of open source.
I try to run all my devices on open source software and I try to stay up to
date on new open source technologies.  Right now I am running Arch Linux on my
laptop. Before that I ran Gentoo, which was quite a learning experience.
I still use Windows for gaming from time to time, but I have been happy to
see more an more games coming to Linux. I also find Wine to be useful in running
some Windows games I play like Diablo 3.
